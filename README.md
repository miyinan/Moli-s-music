## player: Python3.7
I made my program with GUI through Python. 
The interactive interface allows you to choose the song to be played, the tempo to be played and the instrument to be used for playing.



## piano: java 15.0.1
I have completed an electronic piano through java. 
This piano covers the range from low F to high E. 
You can play it by clicking on the keys with the mouse or by using the keyboard. 
It supports chord because the mp3 files are played by java multiple threads.
